“Ravenous”, is the cloned version of Yelp.

Yelp:
https://www.yelp.com/

In total, there will be four parts to this project:

1. Creating Static Components
2. Passing Information to Components
3. Setting the State of Ravenous Components
4. Interacting with the Yelp API

Here’s a quick overview of how Ravenous should function:

As a user, I should be able to search for restaurants
As a user, I should be able to view a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API
As a user, I should be able to sort through restaurants using a filter

The four projects will test your knowledge of JavaScript and React. All with the goal of building a Yelp-like clone. 
If you want to get a feel for what Ravenous can be, visit the Yelp website and search for restuarants in your area.
